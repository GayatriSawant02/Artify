🧠 Parts Built Using Vercel v0 (5–10 Lines)

Vercel v0 was used to auto-generate multiple UI components to speed up development.
The Hero Section, Features Cards, Testimonials layout, and Contact Section were created using prompts inside Vercel v0.
These generated components were then customized manually for better spacing, responsiveness, and branding.
The button styles, card layouts, and grid structure for feature items were heavily refined after the base UI was generated.
v0 also helped create consistent typography and visual balance throughout the landing page.
Overall, Vercel v0 significantly accelerated the design workflow while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.
